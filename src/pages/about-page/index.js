            About us
          </h1>
          <p>
            We are a technology AI company using property data to bring to you a
            one-stop platform for all your needs. We have been investing in the
            Australian property market over the last 10 years and have more than
            $4m worth of property portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have helped more than 50 investors use our platform, and who have
            amassed more than $25m of property across the whole nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last 5 years we have been capturing property data from
            various sources and used all our investment strategies to provide
            all tools you need to make an investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our proprietary Machine Learning algorithm can also help predict
            suburbs which are more likely to grow. We donâ€™t provide specific
            property details - we still encourage you to visit domain and real
            estate websites to complete your research. However, our products
            will help you shortlist which suburbs are best suited for you.
          </p>
          <p>Our data is refreshed each week.</p>
