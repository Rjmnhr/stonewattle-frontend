            Over the last 5 years we have been capturing property data from

            Our proprietary Machine Learning algorithm can also help predict
            suburbs which are more likely to grow. We donâ€™t provide specific
            property details - we still encourage you to visit domain and real
            estate websites to complete your research. However, our products
            will help you shortlist which suburbs are best suited for you.
